title: Problem decomposition
time: 30 minutes

* Take a break learning commands to talk about general approaches
* Real computational tasks are complicated. To accomplish them you need to
  **think before you code**.

## Problem decomposition steps (10 minutes)

> Put this up on screen

1. 🤔️
2. 🕺️
3. 🧱️


1.  🤔️ Understand the problem
    1. Restate the problem in your own words
    2. Determine the inputs and outputs
    3. Ask for clarification
2.  🕺️ Break the problem down
    1.  Write down the pieces, on paper or as comments in a file
    2.  Break complicated pieces down until all pieces are small and manageable
3.  🧱️ Code one small piece at a time
    1.  Test it on it's own
    2.  Fix any problems before proceeding

## Breaking down an exercise (15 minutes)

* This week we will be working on more complex exercises
* Show end result of first exercise
* Take time 5 minutes to read through one of the exercises
* Then we'll try to break it down into pieces as a class

## Start simple



1. Experiment
2. Write a simpler version
3. Make sure it works
4. Make sure you understand it
5. Modify it to make it more complicated
6. Repeat until finished
