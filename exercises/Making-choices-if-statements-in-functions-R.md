1. Write a function named `double_if_small` that takes a number as input and returns the number multiplied by 2 if the input is less than 26 and returns just the number (not multiplied by two) if the input is greater than or equal to 26. Call the function with `10` as the input.
2. Call the function from (1) with `30` as the input.
3. Write a function called `prediction` that takes a single argument `x`. If `x` is both greater than 0 and less than 15 then return `y = 6 + 0.8 * x`. If `x` is both greater than 15 and less than 30 then return `y = 5 + 0.75 * x`. In all other cases return `y = NA`. Call the function with `5` as the input.
4. Call the function from (3) with `26` as the input.
5. Call the function from (3) with `-2` as the input.
